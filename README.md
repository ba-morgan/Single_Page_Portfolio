# Single Page Portfolio

A very simple one page portfolio site.

## Description :

Yes, you've got me, this site really is just a single page of HTML 5 with a CSS 3 file. It was intentional really !

For me this was a short experiment in simplicity. I wanted to see just how simply I could produce a portfolio site.

As a portfolio is essentially an online Profile / CV, I thought why not make it like a simple one-page flyer.

So all the essentials are immediately visible and easy to read or see. Obviously there's not enough space on one page to go into real details about everything, just the essentials.

I Decided to extend this simplicity to the rest of the project. So a simple structure, simple UI and simple deployment.

This meant no frameworks, no animation, no menus and no scrolling to find information.
